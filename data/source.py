        "context": "We put a lot of time, effort, and money into looking beautiful (or handsome, depending on your gender). Americans fork over nearly $9 billion annually for creams, scrubs, concealers, and a drawerful of other cosmetics that claim to keep our skin looking clean, clear, and more youthful. Ironically, the very same products you rely on to keep your skin looking its best could be doing your pores a big disservice. Using the wrong makeup or cream could actually accentuate the pimples you're trying so hard to hide. Caring for acne-prone skin requires some careful cosmetic sleuthing -- reading labels to find products that won't clog your pores and lead to more breakouts. Web MD has made the process a little easier by compiling a checklist of must-have makeup and grooming ingredients for people with acne. Use this acne skin-care checklist when navigating the aisles of cosmetics and makeup at your local supermarket or drug store. Somehow, the idea that moisturizers are a no-no for pimple-prone skin started circulating many years back, and now a lot of people with acne avoid them like the plague. In reality, moisturizers are an essential part of the acne skin care routine. The acne treatment your dermatologist prescribed or recommended may contain drying ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, which can suck the moisture out of your skin and leave it looking red and irritated. A good moisturizer will keep the water in your skin and help avoid unsightly drying and peeling. What to look for: Choose a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer labeled \"non-comedogenic\" -- which is just a fancy way of saying that it won't clog your pores. Also look for ingredients like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which hold moisture in the skin. What to avoid? Heavy, greasy products that contain pimple-producing ingredients such as cocoa butter, mineral oil, or cold cream. There's no need to slather your face in day-glo green or mud and scare off all the neighborhood kids. Experts say masks and scrubs do little, if anything, to improve acne. A gentle, non-abrasive cleanser that's formulated for your skin type (oily, dry, or combination) will do a lot more to keep your face pimple-free. Men with acne need to pay attention to their skin care regimen, too. Shaving can be both a plus and minus for a man's skin. The plus is that shaving each day acts as a natural exfoliant, opening your pores so the excess oil can drain out. But if you shave the wrong way or use the wrong products, you could wind up with more acne. Or, you could get razor bumps, which aren't acne but look a lot like them. Razor bumps pop up when newly cut, sharp-ended hairs turn back into the skin and make the skin swell up. What to look for: Use a non-irritating, lubricating shaving gel, or a prescription shaving foam containing benzoyl peroxide or a topical antibiotic that's designed for men with acne. When you shave, use a sharp razor so you don't pull on the hair or cut your skin. Shave downward, in the direction of growth of the hair follicles, to prevent irritation. After shaving, skip the splash of cologne or alcohol-based aftershave, which can irritate your skin -- not to mention leave you in agony if you have any open cuts or recently popped pimples. Use an oil-free moisturizer or a prescription topical antibiotic lotion or gel instead. People have been covering up their blemishes for centuries. In the 1600s, women wore star-and moon-shaped silk patches to hide their smallpox scars. Today, we use makeup to camouflage our pimples, but applying layer after layer of cover-up when you have acne isn't necessarily the best approach. Makeup can be very good at hiding pimples, but it can also accentuate zits if you use the wrong kind of concealer or slather it on too thickly. The redness and peeling many acne treatments leave behind can look even worse when smeared with thick makeup. What to look for: All of your makeup, from blush to eye shadow, should be non-greasy, non-comedogenic (or non-acnegenic), hypoallergenic, non-irritating, and oil-free. Read the ingredients -- the very first one should be water. Mineral-based cosmetics contain added ingredients like silica, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide, which both absorb oil and hide redness without irritating skin and causing pimples. Another ingredient to look for is dimethicone, which also conceals redness while smoothing out uneven skin. Pick a makeup color that complements your skin tone. When applying foundation, a little goes a long way. Use about a quarter-sized amount, and blend it into your entire face. Allow your foundation to dry for a few minutes before putting on the rest of your makeup. If you notice that your skin is red, itchy, or swollen after you apply a certain type of makeup, stop using it. Some ingredients in cosmetics cause an allergic irritation known as contact dermatitis in certain people. Contrary to popular belief, sunscreen doesn't cause acne. And while red, sunburned skin might temporarily hide your pimples, getting burned too many times can also leave you with premature lines and wrinkles, and increase your risk for skin cancer. You want to protect your skin when you're outside in the sun without slathering on gobs of greasy sunscreen. What to look for: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and a physical blocker like zinc oxide of at least 6% too protect against both UVA and UVB light. A water-based or light liquid-based gel or spray-on sunscreen is best for people who tend to get breakouts. You can also look for light lotions and powder sunscreens. Look for \u00e2\u0080\u009cnoncomedogenic\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the label, which means it should not clog your skin's pores. Watch out for chemicals such as PABA and benzophenone, which can irritate sensitive skin."

        "context": "Pycnogenol is a compound of natural chemicals. It comes from the bark of a European pine tree. Pycnogenol is thought to be an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage. Pycnogenol is the registered trademark name for a French formula. The active ingredients in pycnogenol can also be extracted from other sources, including peanut skin, grape seed, and witch hazel bark. Pycnogenol seems to help with asthma and allergies. Early research shows that taking it at least 5 weeks before the start of allergy season seems to lessen symptoms. In a small/preliminary study of kids with asthma, pycnogenol helped improve symptoms. It also lessened the amount of asthma medication they needed. Pycnogenol may have benefits for heart and artery health. It seems to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow to the legs. Some small studies suggest it may also protect against coronary artery disease and blood clots. There's good evidence that pycnogenol helps with eye damage caused by diabetes. There is limited evidence that it could be used in treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD). More research is needed to see how this supplement affects all of these conditions. Pycnogenol may help with other conditions as well. They include: Arthritis Diabetes Erectile dysfunction High cholesterol Memory problems Menopause symptoms Pain during pregnancy Swelling We need more research to know for sure if pycnogenol helps treat these conditions. Optimal doses of pycnogenol have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely from maker to maker. This makes it very hard to set a standard dose. Ask your doctor for advice. Traditionally, people might drink a brew made from pine bark -- rich in pycnogenol -- as a treatment. Tell your doctor about any supplements you're taking, even if they're natural. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with medications. Side effects. Pycnogenol seems well-tolerated for use in adults for up to 6 months. It may cause side effects such as: Dizziness Vertigo Upset stomach Risks. Pycnogenol may stimulate the immune system. So it may not be safe for people with immune disorders, such as: Lupus Multiple sclerosis ( MS) Rheumatoid arthritis It's not known if pycnogenol is safe for children or for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Interactions. If you take any medications regularly, talk to your doctor before you start using pycnogenol supplements. They could interact with medicines to suppress the immune system, chemotherapy drugs, and blood thinners. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) does regulate dietary supplements; however, it treats them like foods rather than medications. Unlike drug manufacturers, the makers of supplements don't have to show their products are safe or effective before selling them on the market."

        "context": "Your toe is red, swollen, and sore. Could it be infected? Toe infections are common -- especially in people with diabetes or a weakened immune system. Knowing what caused your infection can help you figure out whether you can treat it yourself, or you need to call a doctor. An infection in the skin around the toenail is called paronychia. It's normally caused by a bacterium. The toenail can also be infected with a fungus. If your toe is infected, one of these things might be to blame: You cut the nail too short, or you cut the cuticle around the nail. You have an ingrown toenail (the side of your nail grows into the skin). You've picked up a fungus, which you can get if you walk barefoot in common areas like a gym shower or locker room. You have a callus -- thickened skin caused by rubbing (for example, when your toe rubs against your shoe). You put your feet in water a lot (for example, if you swim a lot). You're more likely to get an infected toe if you have diabetes. Damage to your blood vessels from high blood sugar can make it harder for your body to fight off infections. And diabetic nerve damage can prevent you from feeling minor trauma that could lead to a toe infection. If you have a weakened immune system, you're also more likely to get toe infections. This includes people with HIV, or those who've had an organ transplant. You might have an infected toe if you notice: Redness Soreness or pain A pus-filled blister, or pus that drains from your toe Cracked, thickened, yellow toenails (from a fungal infection) Diabetes can prevent you from feeling that you might have an infection, so check your feet every day. Look for redness, swelling, pus, and other signs of infection. Make an appointment with your primary care doctor or a podiatrist (foot specialist) if the redness, swelling, and other symptoms don't go away with home treatment. See your doctor right away if: You have a fever or chills You notice red streaks on the skin leading away from the infected area Your joints or muscles hurt Your doctor will examine your toe. You might need tests to find out what type of bacteria or fungus caused the infection. Get regular checkups from your podiatrist if you have diabetes, so you can find infections and other problems early. See the doctor more often if you have any known foot problems, like an ingrown toenail. If bacteria caused the infection, an antibiotic cream or pill can clear up the problem. Fungal infections are treated with antifungal pills or cream. You can buy antifungal medicines over the counter or with a prescription from your doctor. To treat an ingrown toenail, your doctor might lift the nail and place a piece of cotton or a splint underneath it. This will help the nail grow away from your skin. If lifting doesn't work, the doctor can remove part or all of the affected nail. Sometimes the infection can cause a pus-filled blister to form. Your doctor might have to drain the blister. You can also try these remedies at home: Soak the toe for about 15 minutes in a bathtub or bucket filled with warm water and salt. Do this three to four times a day. Rub a medicated ointment on the toe and wrap it in a clean bandage. To treat an ingrown toenail, gently lift the corner of the nail. Place a small piece of cotton or waxed dental floss underneath to hold the nail away from your skin. You'll also want to protect your toe while it heals. To help it heal properly, wear loose, comfortable shoes that don't rub. Keep your foot dry, and change your socks every day."

        "context": "When you have a child with type 1 diabetes, meal planning is important. Everything your child eats can affect his blood sugar. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can help you come up with the best plan for your child, but there's information all parents of kids with this condition should know. Good Nutrition Like all children, kids with type 1 diabetes need nutrient-rich foods that help them grow and keep them at a healthy weight. Over the course of a day, your child should get about 10%-20% of his calories from protein, 25%-30% calories from healthy fats, and about 50%-60% from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates Carbs are found in most foods -- not just bread and potatoes. They supply the energy that the body and brain need to work their best. Steer your child toward complex carbs such as vegetables and whole grains. They have vitamins and minerals that will keep him healthy, and fiber, which helps control blood sugar levels. Try to stay away from simple carbs, like white bread and pasta and other processed grains, candy and frosting. They can raise blood sugar quickly. The amount of carbs your child needs depends on his weight, age, size, exercise level, and any medicines he's taking. Your doctor or dietitian can help you figure out the number of grams or serving sizes your child should have each day. Carb Counting Many families keep their child's blood sugar levels steady by counting the number of carbohydrates eaten at every meal or snack, then adjusting insulin doses for it. On packaged foods, the number of total carbs per serving is listed on the label. You can subtract the grams of dietary fiber since this isn't digested. Then multiply the total by how many servings of that food your child eats. If you're cooking at home or eating out, you can look up carb counts and portion sizes of foods online. Constant Carbohydrate Plan Another option is to have your child eat a set amount of carbohydrates at every meal and snack. He'll need to eat at the same times every day, and also take insulin at set times. You don't have to eat the same foods everyday. You just need to stick to the total carbs set for each meal and snack. Keeping to a schedule works well for many kids. Exchange Meal Plan With an \u00e2\u0080\u009cexchange plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d your child's menu will include the amount he can eat from six different food groups: starch, fruit, milk, fat, vegetable, and meat. One food can be exchanged for another with the same amount of calories, protein, carbs, and fats. In children with type 1, dietitians often will focus on carb exchanges since this affects blood sugars the most. You can find exchange lists online. Foods To Avoid There are no specific foods that are off-limits to your child, but there are things to consider when meal planning and grocery shopping. People with diabetes have a higher risk of developing heart disease. Because of that, it's good to steer your child away from fatty foods that contain cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fat. Avoid foods high in salt. Eating too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure. Limit sugary foods like candy, cookies, frosting, or soda that raise blood sugar quickly. They're best given at a meal and with insulin. You'll adjust insulin based on carb counting. Your child doesn't have to miss out on treats for special occasions like birthdays or Halloween. You'll just have to account for those carbs over the course of the day. Snacks to Keep on Hand \u00e2\u0080\u009c Free\u00e2\u0080\u009d snacks like cucumbers and celery or sugar-free gelatin contain very few carbs, so they won't have much effect on your child's blood sugar. You can also have \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrolled-carb snacks\u00e2\u0080\u009d handy to for between meals. Some good kid-friendly choices: low-fat string cheese, a hard-boiled egg, or a small serving of nuts with a sugar-free drink. Highs and Lows If your child eats more than expected or at a different time than you've planned, he may get high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia. If this happens, you may need to make some adjustments. Talk to your diabetes team about adjusting his meal plan or his doses of insulin or other medication. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can cause serious problems that need treatment right away. Your child's glucose levels can drop if he skips a meal or snack or doesn't eat as many carbs as expected. It can also happen if he takes his insulin at the wrong time or exercises more than usual without eating extra snacks or adjusting his insulin. If your child's levels are low, give him a sugary food. Regular soda, orange juice, or even cake frosting raise glucose levels quickly. You can also keep glucose tablets on hand or talk to your doctor about a glucagon kit. Glucagon is a hormone that treats a severe low blood sugar reaction. Keep Track Keep a record of your child's carb intake, insulin doses, and blood sugar readings. These numbers can help you and your doctor see if his meal plan is working."

        "context": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare kind of cancer that usually starts in the glands that make saliva. These are under your tongue and on each side of your jaw below the jawbone. But it also can occur in other parts of your mouth and throat or other areas of your body, such as your sweat glands or tear glands. Of the 500,000 people who get cancer each year, about 1,200 of them have adenoid cystic carcinoma. It affects more women than men, and it can happen at any age between your teens and your 80s. It tends to grow slowly, so it sometimes can spread to other parts of your body before you notice any symptoms. It can come back in places where it's been treated before or spread to your lungs, liver, or bones, where it's more serious. Doctors don't know what causes adenoid cystic carcinoma. It may be linked to some carcinogens, like pollution or asbestos. The first sign may be a lump inside your mouth under your tongue or inside your cheek. These lumps usually grow slowly and don't hurt. You might have some trouble swallowing, or your voice might sound hoarse. This type of cancer can spread along nerves, so you might have some pain or numbness in your face. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor. If your doctor thinks you might have adenoid cystic carcinoma, the first step is often a biopsy. She'll take a small sample of the tumor, either after making a small cut or with a needle. A pathologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of diseases, will study the sample to look for signs of cancer. These kinds of tumors can take different forms. They can be solid or round and hollow like a tube, or cribriform, which means they have holes in them like Swiss cheese. The solid tumors usually grow faster. Your doctor might want to find out the size and location of a tumor or look for signs the cancer has spread. You might have one of these tests: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images. CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information. PET scan (positron emission tomography): Radiation is used to make 3-dimensional color images. The usual treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgery followed by radiation treatments. When you have surgery, your doctor will remove not only the tumor but also some of the healthy tissue around it. He'll look at that tissue to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the tumor. Unlike many other cancers, which can go to other parts of your body through your lymph nodes, adenoid cystic carcinoma spreads along your nerves. Your doctor will look at your nerves to make sure the cancer isn't in the area around them and will try to remove any cancerous tissue without damaging them. Sometimes, part of a nerve may have to be removed to get all the cancer out. That can mean you won't be able to move part of your face or it might droop. Your doctor may try to reconnect the damaged nerve with part of another nerve so you can move the affected area. Other times, part of your windpipe or voice box has to be removed. If your doctor can't take out the entire tumor without hurting important organs, or if he's worried the cancer has spread somewhere he hasn't seen, you may have radiation treatments. There are three main kinds: External beam radiation focuses high-energy X-rays or protons on cancer cells to destroy them. Your doctor will try to do as little damage as possible to the surrounding parts of your body. Internal radiation therapy is also known as brachytherapy. Your doctor will put small radioactive \"seeds\" at or near the tumor. This is often used when cancer has spread to the lungs. The radioactivity of the seeds lessens after a few weeks. Neutron therapy can target small tumors by heating up the cells with 100 times more energy than regular radiation treatment. That often kills cancer cells while letting the normal cells around them recover. Radiation therapy focused on your head and neck has side effects that can include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, or soreness around the area that's being treated. It can also damage your teeth. Check with your doctor about these side effects and ask what she can do to help you with them. It can be hard to get rid of the cancer entirely. Tumors may come back years later, either in the same place or, more likely, somewhere else -- usually in your lungs. Most people who have adenoid cystic carcinoma live at least 5 years after their diagnosis. After your treatment, you'll need regular checkups to look for signs of new tumors. This can involve X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, depending on your diagnosis."

        "context": "No one wants to see family members, friends, or colleagues get sick. That's why it's important to understand \"the rules\" on how to keep the highly contagious flu virus to yourself and avoid spreading it to others. Mainly from person to person in droplets that fly out when you cough or sneeze. These tiny drops from a sick person move through the air and land on the mouths or noses of others nearby. Germs are also passed along when you touch mucus droplets from someone else on a surface like a desk and then touch your own eyes, mouth, or nose before you get a chance to wash your hands. Viruses like the flu can live up to 24 hours or longer on plastic and metal surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and cups. 1. Keep your distance. It's easy to pass on germs when you live in close quarters, especially during the winter when we're all indoors. Avoid close contactwith colleagues, friends, or family members if you have the flu or a cold. Tell them you're sick and you don't want them to catch what you have. 2. Stay home. If you feel sick, don't go to work. Keep ailing kids home from school, too. An adult can infect other people one day before symptoms show up and up to 5 days after they start. You could spread flu to others before you know you're sick. If you go back to work or school within 5 days after your symptoms started, chances you're still contagious. 3. Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough . This goes a long way toward protecting others from your germs. Use a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Afterward, toss the tissue and wash your hands thoroughly to remove germs. 4. Wash your hands -- a lot. This is the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. If you have young children, teach them to wash often with warm soapy water. Tell them to rub their hands and fingers while singing Happy Birthday to You -- twice. Once isn't enough time to get all the germs off. Alcohol-based hand disinfectants work great, too. Make sure your kids' teachers have plenty during flu season. Keep some in your desk and car, too. Wash or disinfect your hands any time you touch something a sick person might have handled. Computer keyboards, telephones, doorknobs, elevator buttons, faucet handles, countertops, and railings get lots of hand traffic. 5. When you wash your hands in a public restroom: Run the water until it's warm. Get a paper towel and hold it under one arm (toilet paper will do, too). Put soap on your hands. Sing Happy Birthday to You twice while you wash. Rinse thoroughly. Soap doesn't kill all the germs, but it does let them slide off under warm water. Use the paper towel to turn off the water. If there isn't an air dryer, use it to work the lever to get more towels. Dry your hands and grab a towel to open the door as you leave. 6. Don't touch your face. If droplets from a sick person get into your nose, mouth, or eyes, you'll probably get the flu, too. Remember, most people get it when they touch surfaces these droplets have landed on, then touch their face before washing. 7. Practice good health habits in general. Get plenty of sleep. Eat a well-balanced diet. Take time to relax each day to manage your stress. And exercise at least half an hour 5 days a week. The No. 1 way to avoid catching it is to get a flu shot. You may also want to see a doctor about flu drugs or antiviral meds if there are people in your house at high risk of flu complications. This includes children younger than 24 months, adults over age 65, or people with chronic diseases or severe asthma. These medications really work to prevent flu complications, but you have to take them soon after exposure to the virus."

        "context": "If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have oral health problems like cavities and gum disease. If you have diabetes and you're over 50, your risk is even higher. That's because dental problems and age go hand in hand, whether or not you have diabetes. The good news is that controlling your diabetes will go a long way toward protecting your teeth and gums. And that, in turn, will also help you manage your diabetes. If you have diabetes, keep an eye out for these oral health conditions -- especially if you've already reached the half-century mark. Gum disease is the most common oral health problem among people with diabetes. The first stage of gum disease is called gingivitis. This is when bacteria cause your gums to bleed, turn red, and feel sore. Bacteria love to feast on sugar, turning it into tooth-damaging acid. Uncontrolled diabetes means more sugar in your saliva, and that means a free banquet for bacteria. As bacteria gather, they combine with saliva and pieces of leftover food to form plaque. When it builds up, it leads to tooth decay and gum disease. Regular brushing and flossing, as well as rinsing with antiseptic mouthwash will get rid of it and stop gingivitis in its tracks. If left untreated, gingivitis can turn into periodontitis, a more serious type of gum disease that erodes the bone and tissues that support your teeth. In the worst case, you might lose your teeth. If you don't floss and brush regularly, bacteria and plaque can build up on your teeth. That causes your gums to pull away from them. It creates pockets where bacteria dig in and wage war on more and more parts of your mouth, including bones. Periodontitis can't be reversed and can't be treated with brushing and flossing alone. Your dentist will have to get involved. He may even send you to a specialist called a periodontist. Some people need gum surgery to save their teeth. Both diabetes and older age (especially if you're a woman) slow down saliva production. This puts you at risk for dry mouth, which your doctor might call xerostomia. Saliva makes the enzymes that attack bacteria. Without it, bacteria grow unchecked. Dry mouth can lead not only to sores and ulcers but also to even more tooth decay and gum disease. Bacteria aren't the only organisms that like sugar. So do fungi, which is why a fungal yeast infection called thrush is common in people with diabetes. Thrush can cause white or red patches on your tongue and inside your cheeks. Sometimes they turn into open sores. If you wear dentures, smoke, or take antibiotics, you may be even more likely to get thrush. The yeast thrives on the extra sugar in your saliva and especially likes moist spots like areas under loose-fitting dentures. Thrush is just one kind of mouth infection diabetes puts you at risk for. There are others, including other fungal infections. Both thrush and dry mouth can lead to burning mouth syndrome. So can certain medications, including some for high blood pressure. In addition to feeling like you just scalded your mouth with coffee, your mouth could tingle or feel numb. You might lose some of your ability to taste. This can also result from aging. This isn't really harmful, unless you make up for the lack of taste by adding sugar to your food. That will boost your risk of cavities and gum disease. You may have noticed that wounds and infections take longer to heal. That's a byproduct of both diabetes and getting older. At the same time, your risk of infection goes up. That plus slower healing means that if something does go wrong with your gums or teeth, it'll take longer to get better. And it might get worse faster. This can also be a problem after dental surgery. If you keep your blood sugar in check and brush and floss daily as well as rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash, you'll stop most tooth and gum disease before it has a chance to set in."

        "context": "Children start puberty at different ages based on many factors, including activity level, race, and genes. Precocious puberty can be a sign of a medical condition that calls for a doctor's attention. Other times, precocious puberty has no apparent reason but can be slowed down with treatment. In this article, Web MD lets parents know what to look for and when to call the pediatrician about early puberty. When a child has precocious puberty, she or he starts developing sexual characteristics early, before ages 7 or 8 for girls and age 9 for boys. The exact age is a matter of debate. Some doctors have suggested lowering the official age of precocious puberty. Others say that doing so will lead to not identifying children who would benefit from treatment. Further complicating matters are racial differences in how soon puberty starts. By age 8, 38% of African- American boys and 48% of African- American girls show some signs of puberty. By comparison, 28% of white boys and 14% of white girls have begun to develop by the same age. So far, it's unclear what portion of this age difference is due to race. Parents concerned about their children's development can compare their child's age to how old they were when they started puberty. In the end, parents and pediatricians need to look at the child's development and the many factors surrounding it to determine what defines too early. Parents who think their child has precocious puberty should see their pediatrician. Rarely, early puberty is the first sign of a serious medical condition like a tumor or neurological disorder. Treating the condition can put puberty on hold until the appropriate age. Often puberty simply starts early for no apparent medical reason. While it may be a relief to know precocious puberty is not usually a sign of a more serious medical condition, kids with precocious puberty may stop growing before they reach their full adult height. They also face possible teasing by other kids. Bones matures during puberty, and when puberty starts early, the growth spurt begins and ends sooner than normal. At first, children with precocious puberty tower over their friends who haven't started to grow. But within a few years, they may stand among the shortest in their class. Diagnosing the condition early can help the child's growth return to the appropriate pre-precocious rate. Early puberty looks like \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d puberty, except it starts at a younger age. The signs include breast development, penis and/or testicle growth, rapid jumps in height, pubic or underarm hair, and acne. Suddenly a teenager's body odor may fill the air. All familiar signs, except for the timing. Puberty starts for girls with the development of breast buds. Later changes include the development of pubic hair, underarm hair, and acne. During puberty, girls typically grow 2 to 3 inches each year, but have their largest growth spurt on average around age 12 1/2. Puberty ends for girls when menstruation starts. If a girl shows any sign of beginning puberty -- the onset of breasts -- before turning age 7, she may have precocious puberty. The first sign of puberty in boys is the enlargement of the testicles and scrotum. That is followed by pubic hair, penis growth, underarm hair, and voice change. The typical growth spurt for boys occurs later -- usually closer to age 14. Boys younger than age 9 who show signs of puberty should be seen by a doctor. Your pediatrician will probably start out asking a lot of questions about the child's development and both parents' medical history. A physical exam allows the doctor to compare the child's development to his or her actual age. Blood and urine tests help detect abnormal hormone levels. Doctors sometimes use imaging and scanning tests ( CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound) to look for tumors that could have set off early puberty. In most cases, however, there is no apparent anatomical cause. An X-ray of the child's wrist can help determine how quickly the bones are maturing. If the bone age is far ahead of the child's actual age -- for instance, if a child of age 6 has a bone age of 11 -- the child is in danger of not growing to his or her full height. Your pediatrician may refer you to a pediatric endocrinologist for evaluation and treatment. Many parents of children with precocious puberty choose to put their child on a treatment that lowers the level of sex hormones and slows puberty to a crawl. Delaying puberty can give the child's bones a chance to grow at their own pace for a longer period of time. It also gives the child's mind, emotions, and social skills a chance to come up to speed. Puberty can then happen later, when all systems are ready to take it on together. When children have precocious puberty, parents and doctors need to work together to determine the best course of action. The following questions can help parents get the conversation started. What tests are you going to use to determine if my child has precocious puberty? Do you see any signs to suggest this is caused by a tumor or some other medical condition? What options are available to treat this condition? What are the side effects? How long do you recommend my child stay on this treatment? How will I know if the treatment is working or not working? What local services are available to help me support my child's emotional well-being? By working closely with medical professionals who understand precocious puberty, parents can make sure their children have the best possible childhood."

        "context": "Sea buckthorn is a shrub native to China and areas of Europe. It contains many medicinal compounds, as well as nutrients that include: Vitamins Amino acids Fatty acids Minerals The leaves, flowers, seeds, and berries of sea buckthorn are used in teas, oils, or concentrates for a wide variety of health issues. For hundreds of years, sea buckthorn has been used in Russia and China for its medical and nutritional qualities. Sea buckthorn is thought to remove free radicals -- molecules that can damage cells. Most scientific evidence is from animal studies. Though not proven in human clinical trials, people say they take sea buckthorn specifically to try to: Treat stomach or intestinal problems Improve blood pressure or blood cholesterol Prevent or manage blood vessel or heart disease Complement cancer treatment Boost immunity and prevent infections Treat obesity Improve symptoms of cirrhosis Improve eyesight or dry eyes Treat respiratory problems such as asthma, colds, and pneumonia People also use sea buckthorn as a sunscreen or cosmetic, and for a variety of skin problems such as: Radiation damage Exanthemata, a skin rash usually found in children Bedsores, burns, or cuts Acne, dermatitis, or dry skin There isn't enough evidence to confirm that sea buckthorn works for most of these health problems. But there is some limited research showing it might be helpful for: Dry eyes Atopic dermatitis In animal studies, sea buckthorn has also shown some promise in slowing the growth of tumors and ulcers. But more studies are needed. Optimal doses of sea buckthorn have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely. This makes it very hard to set a standard dose. Sea buckthorn fruit or fruit juice can be found in certain jellies, juices, purees, sauces, drinks, and liquors. People do not usually eat the berries raw because they are acidic. The amount of sea buckthorn used in food is typically much less than that used for medicinal purposes. As a food, sea buckthorn is probably safe. Some research suggests it may also be safe when taken up to six months as a medicine. Side effects. Very few side effects from sea buckthorn have been reported. In some people who had high blood pressure, swelling, headache, dizziness and palpitations were noted. When used on the skin to treat burns, it sometimes caused a rash. Risks. Sea buckthorn can act as a blood thinner, causing bleeding. It may also cause low blood sugar in people with diabetes who take medication to lower blood sugar. Interactions. Combining sea buckthorn with blood-thinning drugs or supplements could raise your risk of bleeding. Sea buckthorn may also interfere with certain medicines that treat gastrointestinal conditions, heart rhythm problems, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Avoid using sea buckthorn if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. There is not enough information to prove its safety. The FDA does not regulate supplements. Be sure to tell your doctor about any supplements you're taking, even if they're natural. That way, your doctor can check on any potential side effects or interactions with medications, foods, or other herbs and supplements. He or she can let you know if the supplement might raise your risks."

        "context": "Uveitis can lead to serious eye problems if you don't treat it right away. If you've had it for a long time, or if you have it and are over 60, your chance of having those problems goes up. The disease causes inflammation in your eye. If you don't treat the inflammation, it can scar or break down tissues. That can harm your vision. Untreated, uveitis can cause other problems, such as: These cloud the lens of your eye, which makes it harder for you to see. Inflammation can cause them. You may also be at risk for them if you take steroids for your uveitis. You may hardly notice your cataract at first. Slowly, your sight may seem blurry or hazy. You might feel like you're looking at things through a cloud. It can be hard to see when you drive at night. Lights may glare, too. Surgery can remove your cataract. But most eye doctors will want your inflammation under control for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. This can be tricky if you take steroids for your uveitis. Talk with your doctor about it. This can happen when the fluid inside of your eye can't drain out. All the fluid buildup causes pressure. That damages the optic nerve at the back of your eye. As it gets worse, so does your vision. Glaucoma also can make your vision hazy or cloudy. You may see halos or rings around lights. Other signs are patchy blind spots as you look forward or to the side. Later, you may have tunnel vision. You could also get headaches, eye pain, or nausea. Damage can come slowly, so you may not notice it at first. But your eye doctor can test you for glaucoma and treat it if you have it. Fast action can help you save your eyesight. Steroids could also make you more likely to get glaucoma. Inflammation inside your eye can also cause your retina to swell. Your retina is a thin layer of tissue around the back of your eye. It's full of light-sensitive cells and nerve cells. They take in sights around you and send that information to your optic nerve and your brain. If your retina swells from uveitis, you can lose some of your vision in the center. You may see a black spot in the middle of your view. It doesn't hurt, though. If this swelling lasts for a long time without treatment, your vision loss may be for good. A swollen retina is also called cystoid macular edema. That's because the center of your retina is called the macula. It's not as common, but uveitis can make your retina detach, or pull away, from blood vessels in your eye. You may see floaters, or small black spots in your vision. You may also see lights flash. If any of these things are happening to you, call your doctor and get treatment quickly. Moving fast can save your eyesight."

        "context": "Medication errors are unfortunately common in the practice of health care. Hospital medication errors are especially scary. How would you even know if a nurse is giving you the wrong drug or the wrong dosage? But experts say that you can help prevent such mistakes. Here are some tips. Bring in your medications. Your health care team at the hospital needs to know about every drug you take, whether it's prescription, over-the-counter, or an herbal supplement. One easy way to do this is to bring in all of your medications in a bag to show them. Keep a written or electronic copy. You can keep digital images of your medications on your smart phone or input your medication into a secure mobile application. A written list with the names and dosing of your medication is also useful. Find out if you should continue taking your regular medicines when in the hospital. If you're currently taking a daily medicine -- for high blood pressure or heart disease, for instance -- find out whether you should continue taking it when you're in the hospital. Don't assume that the hospital doctors and nurses will already know the drugs prescribed by your family doctor. You need to tell them explicitly; especially confirm with them the dosage of the medication you take. Always ask. When a nurse comes in to give you a drug, ask questions. What does this drug do? How much do you need? How often do you need it? Asking questions is a key way of lowering the risk of errors. Make sure the medicine is for you. Another way to avoid a serious hospital medication error is to ask your nurse to compare your ID with the name on the prescription before you get it. Keep notes. Before surgery, start up a list of the drugs you'll probably be taking, along with doses and details about why you take the medicine (indication). Bring it with you to the hospital and keep it up to date. This way, you're more likely to notice any changes to your regimen. Ask your family to help out. Since you might be drowsy and forgetful after surgery, it's great to have a family member or friend who's keeping track of your medication for you."

        "context": "Multiple sclerosis ( MS) damages nerves that send messages to your muscles, which makes them harder to control. The ones connected to your bladder are no different. Trouble with bladder control is common for people with MS. But it doesn't have to take over your life. With the right approach, you can get a handle on these issues. There are a few versions that affect people with MS: Urinary urgency means you feel the need to pee often and urgently. The small \"tickle\" and feeling of pressure that help us know it's time to head to the restroom are intense. Incontinence is the loss of bladder control. Sometimes MS will disrupt the nerve signals that direct the movement of urine in your body so that it comes out when you're not ready. Nocturia means you have to get up a lot during the night to go to the bathroom. Urinary hesitancy is when you have trouble starting to pee. A bladder problem is more than an inconvenience. If you don't get treatment, it can turn into other health issues, including bladder infections, kidney damage, and hygiene problems. It also can keep you from doing the things you'd normally do and make you feel isolated. Talk to your doctor if you notice any changes in when and how often you're going to the bathroom. She might recommend that you see a doctor who specializes in bladder problems, called a urologist. She might also talk to you about some things you can do on your own: Diet changes. One way to start is to change the liquid you put in your body every day. Your doctor may recommend that you: Drink no more than 2 quarts of liquids a day Steer clear of drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, and sodas Have no more than one alcoholic drink per day Change your behavior. Some things you can try: Bladder training aims to let you go longer between your trips to the bathroom. You start by setting a schedule for when you'll pee. Then you train yourself to resist the first urge to go and refrain from going until your scheduled time. Eventually, the time between restroom visits lasts for several hours. Timed voiding helps people who have a condition that makes it hard for them to get to a bathroom in time, such as a physical disability. The person follows a schedule with set times to visit the restroom. This method doesn't try to teach the person to resist the urge to go. Prompted voiding trains a caregiver to remind someone to go to the bathroom. The goal is to have fewer accidents by making the person aware that they need to pee every so often. People often use timed voiding at the same time. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which help with bladder control. Your doctor can tell you how to do them. Absorbent products such as mini-shields that attach to underwear or plastic-backed diapers. These items help you guard against accidents. Most of them are disposable, but you can also buy absorbent cloths that you can wash and reuse. Medications. If behavior changes don't work, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help with bladder control. You might also take them while you keep up your behavior training. These drugs help control muscle movements that force urine out of the bladder: Darifenacin ( Enablex) Fesoterodine ( Toviaz) Imipramine ( Tofranil) Oxybutynin ( Ditropan, Gelnique gel, Oxytrol transdermal patch) Solifenacin ( Vesicare) Tolterodine ( Detrol) Trospium ( Sanctura) Mechanical aids such as: Catheters: Your doctor can put this thin, flexible, hollow tube through your urethra, the tube through which pee leaves your body, and into your bladder to drain urine. Urethral insert: A thin, flexible solid tube in the urethra that blocks the flow of leaking urine. External urethral barrier: A self-adhesive patch you can put over the opening where urine comes out. Surgery. Doctors usually recommend an operation only as a last resort when other treatments haven't worked."

        "context": "If you've ever had low back pain, you may have scanned the shelves of your local drugstore or filled a prescription from your doctor. But not all medicines are created equal. Here are some of the most common ones for low back pain. Your doctor may suggest this as a first-line treatment. It works by stopping the pain process. But it doesn't reduce inflammation in the body. Acetaminophen tends to be gentler on the stomach than other meds. But while it can be helpful in relieving toothaches, headaches, and pain after surgery, there's not a lot of evidence to indicate it works as well for back pain. Still, each case is unique. So just because it hasn't been found to be the most effective remedy in clinical trials doesn't mean it won't help you. Risks: It can damage the liver if it's taken in high doses. That's why doctors advise taking around 3,000 milligrams (mg) a day even though the maximum daily dose (according to the FDA) is 4,000 mg. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are alternatives to acetaminophen that you can buy without a prescription. They help fight swelling and fever. Risks: NSAIDs can cause digestive problems like nausea and diarrhea, as well as heartburn and stomach pain. Rarely, they can have serious side effects like internal bleeding and ulcers. They may also cause heart problems and kidney damage. In some cases, your doctor might prescribe these for your low back pain. Some of the most commonly used muscle relaxants are Cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril), Metaxalone ( Skelaxin), and Tizanidine ( Zanaflex). These drugs work by helping to ease spasms in the muscles. Risks: Muscle relaxants carry a big risk of side effects, like drowsiness and dizziness. These might be an option if your pain is neuropathic -- meaning it shoots down your leg. But you probably won't see results right away. Most people get moderate relief after taking these meds for several weeks. These are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants for low back pain: Amitriptyline Clomipramine ( Anafranil) Desipramine ( Norpramin) Doxepin Imipramine ( Tofranil) Nortriptyline ( Pamelor) Risks: While taking antidepressants, you might experience drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and constipation. Doctors sometimes prescribe these for low back pain. But recent research shows that they usually only provide short-term relief. And they carry a lot of risks, like hormonal changes and dependency. For this reason, doctors don't usually prescribe them for chronic, or long-term, pain. If yours does, he'll also likely recommend other therapies, like exercise or lifestyle changes. And, he'll monitor you regularly to make sure they're easing your pain and improving your function without causing harm. Risks: Aside from the possible side effects mentioned above, opioids can also cause nausea and constipation in the short term. Over time, they can lead to depression and sexual dysfunction."

But the opposite is true. A regular, properly designed exercise program may actually help prevent falls and fractures. That's because exercise strengthens bones and muscles and improves balance, coordination, and flexibility. That's key for people with osteoporosis. Before you start a new workout routine, check with your doctor and physical therapist. They can tell you what's safe for your stage of osteoporosis, your fitness level, and your weight. There is no single exercise plan that's best for everyone with osteoporosis. The routine you choose should be unique to you and based on your: Fracture risk Muscle strength Range of motion Level of physical activity Fitness Gait Balance Your doctor also will consider any other health problems that have a bearing on your ability to exercise, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. She may refer you to a specially trained physical therapist who can teach you exercises that focus on body mechanics and posture, balance, resistance weights, and other techniques. Don't let the name fool you -- these types of workouts aren't about pumping iron. They are exercises you do on your feet so that your bones and muscles have to work against gravity to keep you upright. Your bones react to the weight on them by building themselves up and getting stronger. There are two types of weight-bearing exercise: high-impact and low-impact. High-impact includes workouts like: Brisk walking Climbing stairs Dancing Hiking Jogging Jumping rope Step aerobics Tennis or other racquet sports Yard work, like pushing a lawnmower or heavy gardening But be careful. High-impact weight-bearing exercises may not be safe for you if you have a higher chance of breaking a bone. Talk to your doctor about your workout routine. She may recommend that you focus on low-impact exercises that are less likely to cause fractures and still build up your bone density. These include: Elliptical training machines Low-impact aerobics Stair-step machines Walking (either outside or on a treadmill machine) If you're new to exercise or haven't worked out for a while, you should aim to gradually increase the amount you do until you get to 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise per day on most days of the week. Working your muscles matters just as much as building up bone. It can slow the bone loss that happens with osteoporosis and may help prevent fall-related fractures. These workouts can include basic moves such as standing and rising on your toes, lifting your own body weight with exercises like push-ups or squats, and using equipment such as: Elastic exercise bands Free weights Weight machines Add strength-training exercises to your workouts 2 to 3 days per week. These moves don't directly strengthen your bones. They can, though, improve your coordination, flexibility, and muscle strength. That will lower the chance that you'll fall and break a bone. You can do these every day. Balance exercises such as Tai Chi can strengthen your leg muscles and help you stay steadier on your feet. Posture exercises can help you work against the \"sloping\" shoulders that can happen with osteoporosis and lower your chances of spine fractures. Routines such as yoga and Pilates can improve strength, balance, and flexibility in people with osteoporosis. But some of the moves you do in these programs -- including forward-bending exercises -- can make you more likely to get a fracture. If you're interested in these workouts, talk with your doctor and ask your physical therapist to tell you the moves that are safe and those you should avoid. Exercise can benefit almost everyone with osteoporosis. But remember it's only one part of a good treatment plan. Get plenty of calcium and vitamin D in your diet, stay at a healthy weight, and don't smoke or drink too much alcohol. You also may need osteoporosis medications to either build or maintain your bone density. Work with your doctor to figure out the best ways to stay healthy and strong."

For instance, if your child has a mild allergy, such as hay fever, you can expect symptoms such as: Watery, runny eyes Runny nose Sneezing Nasal congestion These symptoms can make your child feel bad, but it's not life-threatening. But sometimes a child can have what's known as anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that needs immediate medical treatment. Many cases are caused by food allergies, medications, or insect stings. Do you know what to watch for? Most anaphylactic reactions have symptoms in two or more areas of the body. Lungs: Trouble breathing or noisy breathing Coughing, wheezing Sneezing Congestion Tightness in the lungs Hoarseness Heart and Blood Vessels Chest pain Low blood pressure Weak, rapid pulse Dizziness, fainting Skin Pale or flushed skin Hives or welts Itchy skin Sweating Mouth Swelling of the throat, face, lips, or tongue Stomach and Digestion Abdominal pain Nausea, vomiting Diarrhea The person's airways narrow and their throat swells, which can make it hard to breathe. Their blood vessels widen, making their blood pressure fall, sometimes to dangerous levels. Anaphylactic reactions usually happen fast. Symptoms often become the most serious within 3 to 30 minutes of exposure to the allergy trigger. Quicker reactions are usually more severe. A child who has had a severe allergic reaction should carry an emergency kit that includes an epinephrine auto-injector. You should know how to use the injector. So should your child's teacher. Your child may also be old enough to use it on herself. Ask her doctor if she's ready for that. As soon as possible after the allergic reaction starts, give the child at one shot of the drug and dial 911. Even if you are not sure the symptoms are allergy related, don't hesitate to give her the injection. Waiting can be much more harmful than the medication. She may need more than one dose, so be prepared to follow up with another within 10 to 20 minutes. The injection isn't a cure. It won't stop a severe allergic reaction. Even if your child seems OK, emergency medical care is a must. Always call 911 or get to the nearest emergency room as soon as possible. Restock any items you use from the emergency kit so it's ready at all times. Like all drugs, epinephrine has an expiration date, so check the dates on each injector."

        "context": "People with multiple sclerosis often have trouble sleeping soundly, but the problems may not be due to the disease itself. Stress, spasticity in arms or legs, inactivity, or depression that can come along with MS can interfere with a good night's rest. In some cases, MS lesions at certain spots within the brain may also keep someone from sleeping normally. Whatever the cause of your sleep issues, some simple fixes may help you get more shut-eye. Talk to your doctor about your problem. She can help you figure out how to solve it and get back to better Zzz's. If a medical problem like spasticity, bladder trouble, or depression is keeping you awake, talk to your doctor about treatments that relieve those conditions. A consistent bedtime routine can also be a big help. Try these tips: Relax in the evening before you go to bed. Try to not rehash the day's problems or worry about tomorrow's schedule. If it's hard to turn your brain off, try routines that can help you wind down, like meditation or breathing exercises. Go to bed when you're tired. Try to hit the sack at about the same time every night. If you can't fall asleep after 10-15 minutes, get up. Don't lie in bed and watch the clock or count the cracks in the wall. Find something to do that's relaxing to you, such as working on a puzzle, reading, or writing a letter to a friend. Rather than watching TV, which doesn't require effort, do something active so that your natural tiredness can build up. But don't do that activity while you're in bed -- keep the sheets for sleeping and sex. Follow these tips, too: Try not to sleep during the day. If you nap, don't snooze for too long or near bedtime. Avoid caffeine and alcohol within 4-6 hours of bedtime. Don't smoke before you go to sleep or during the night. If running to the bathroom is keeping you awake, try to drink less in the evenings. Get your recommended amount of fluids during the day instead. And use the restroom right before you go to bed. Don't go to bed hungry or soon after a heavy meal. If your stomach is growling, eat a light snack or drink a glass of warm milk. Exercise regularly, preferably during the day. Avoid vigorous exercise 3 hours before bedtime. Set your alarm to wake you up at the same time every day, even on days when you're off work and on the weekends. If you still can't seem to get enough sleep, talk to your doctor. She can help you figure out what's going on. She can also refer you to a sleep specialist if necessary."

        "context": "Your pelvis is the lower part of your belly, below your navel and between your hips. There are a lot of organs in this tight space -- your bladder, cervix, intestines, rectum, urethra, uterus, and vagina. Sometimes, the muscles and other kinds of tissue that hold everything in place get stretched out, weak, or torn. When that happens, some of your body parts can drop down below where they're supposed to be. Some of your body tissue can stick out of your vagina. This is called prolapse. It can affect all the organs in your pelvis. Nearly half of all women between ages 50 and 79 have at least a little bit of pelvic organ prolapse ( POP). It doesn't always cause symptoms, so you could actually have it and not know it. Men can get POP, too, if their bladders or rectums drop down. If you delivered a baby through your vagina (not by C-section), you have the biggest risk for POP. The more times you give birth, the higher your risk. But just because you've had babies, doesn't mean you're going to have a prolapse. Other things can raise your risk, like: Having surgery or radiation on your pelvic area Breaking your back or the bones in your pelvis Chronic constipation, because of the pushing and straining Chronic cough (it puts pressure on your pelvic organs) Obesity Doing a lot of heavy lifting over and over Getting older Having family members who have it Being white Having a hysterectomy Giving birth for the first time at a young age Smoking Pelvic organ prolapse is rarely life threatening. But it can cause a few problems, such as: Bladder control problems (urinary incontinence) A kink in the urethra, the tube that carries your urine outside your body. This can make it hard to pee. Bowel control problems (fecal incontinence), with liquid or solid stools coming out Problems having bowel movements when stools get trapped Pain during sex Urinary tract infections Kidney damage if it blocks your pee There are things you can to do tighten your pelvic muscles and reduce your risk. For instance, Kegel exercises can help strengthen the nerves and muscles in your pelvis. Making certain lifestyle changes might help, too. If you're overweight, for example, try to shed some pounds. Overweight women are more likely to get POP than those who maintain a healthy weight. Drink lots of fluids and eat high-fiber foods. This will help you to avoid constipation. Remember, constantly pushing and straining will only make the prolapse worse. Try not to lift anything heavy. If you must, learn to lift the right way --with your legs, not your back or abs. If you smoke, stop. Smoking increases your risk of POP. And see a doctor about any health issues you might have, like a cough that won't go away. Coughing puts pressure on your pelvic muscles and can make your prolapse worse."

        "context": "Through the hormones it produces, the thyroid gland influences almost all of the metabolic processes in your body. Thyroid disorders can range from a small, harmless goiter (enlarged gland) that needs no treatment to life-threatening cancer. The most common thyroid problems involve abnormal production of thyroid hormones. Too much thyroid hormone results in a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Insufficient hormone production leads to hypothyroidism. Although the effects can be unpleasant or uncomfortable, most thyroid problems can be managed well if properly diagnosed and treated. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } All types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones, but the condition can occur in several ways: Graves' disease: The production of too much thyroid hormone. Toxic adenomas: Nodules develop in the thyroid gland and begin to secrete thyroid hormones, upsetting the body's chemical balance; some goiters may contain several of these nodules. Subacute thyroiditis: Inflammation of the thyroid that causes the gland to \"leak\" excess hormones, resulting in temporary hyperthyroidism that generally lasts a few weeks but may persist for months. Pituitary gland malfunctions or cancerous growths in the thyroid gland: Although rare, hyperthyroidism can also develop from these causes. Hypothyroidism , by contrast, stems from an underproduction of thyroid hormones. Since your body's energy production requires certain amounts of thyroid hormones, a drop in hormone production leads to lower energy levels. Causes of hypothyroidism include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis : In this autoimmune disorder, the body attacks thyroid tissue. The tissue eventually dies and stops producing hormones. Removal of the thyroid gland: The thyroid may have been surgically removed or chemically destroyed. Exposure to excessive amounts of iodide: Cold and sinus medicines, the heart medicine amiodarone, or certain contrast dyes given before some X-rays may expose you to too much iodine. You may be at greater risk for developing hypothyroidism if you have had thyroid problems in the past. Lithium: This drug has also been implicated as a cause of hypothyroidism. Untreated for long periods of time, hypothyroidism can bring on a myxedema coma, a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires immediate hormone treatment. Hypothyroidism poses a special danger to newborns and infants. A lack of thyroid hormones in the system at an early age can lead to the development of cretinism (intellectual disability) and dwarfism (stunted growth). Most infants now have their thyroid levels checked routinely soon after birth. If they are hypothyroid, treatment begins immediately. In infants, as in adults, hypothyroidism can be due to these causes: A pituitary disorder A defective thyroid Lack of the gland entirely A hypothyroid infant is unusually inactive and quiet, has a poor appetite, and sleeps for excessively long periods of time. Cancer of the thyroid gland is quite rare and occurs in about 5% of thyroid nodules. You might have one or more thyroid nodules for several years before they are determined to be cancerous. People who have received radiation treatment to the head and neck earlier in life, possibly as a remedy for acne, tend to have a higher-than-normal risk of developing thyroid cancer."

        "context": "Could someone you know have ADHD? Maybe they're inattentive. Or they might be hyperactive and impulsive. They might have all those traits. There are three groups of symptoms: Inattention Hyperactivity Impulsivity Get the facts on all of them, and learn examples of behaviors that can come with each. You might not notice it until a child goes to school. In adults, it may be easier to notice at work or in social situations. The person might procrastinate, not complete tasks like homework or chores, or frequently move from one uncompleted activity to another. They might also: Be disorganized Lack focus Have a hard time paying attention to details and a tendency to make careless mistakes. Their work might be messy and seem careless. Have trouble staying on topic while talking, not listening to others, and not following social rules Be forgetful about daily activities (for example, missing appointments, forgetting to bring lunch) Be easily distracted by things like trivial noises or events that are usually ignored by others. It may vary with age. You might be able to notice it in preschoolers. ADHD symptoms nearly always show up before middle school. Kids with hyperactivity may: Fidget and squirm when seated. Get up frequently to walk or run around. Run or climb a lot when it's not appropriate. ( In teens this may seem like restlessness.) Have trouble playing quietly or doing quiet hobbies Always be \"on the go\" Talk excessively Toddlers and preschoolers with ADHD tend to be constantly in motion, jumping on furniture and having trouble participating in group activities that call for them to sit still. For instance, they may have a hard time listening to a story. School-age children have similar habits, but you may notice those less often. They are unable to stay seated, squirm a lot, fidget, or talk a lot. Hyperactivity can show up as feelings of restlessness in teens and adults. They may also have a hard time doing quiet activities where you sit still. Symptoms of this include: Impatience Having a hard time waiting to talk or react The person might: Have a hard time waiting for their turn. Blurt out answers before someone finishes asking them a question. Frequently interrupt or intrude on others. This often happens so much that it causes problems in social or work settings. Start conversations at inappropriate times. Impulsivity can lead to accidents, like knocking over objects or banging into people. Children with ADHD may also do risky things without stopping to think about the consequences. For instance, they may climb and put themselves in danger. Many of these symptoms happen from time to time in all youngsters. But in children with the disorder they happen a lot -- at home and school, or when visiting with friends. They also mess with the child's ability to function like other children who are the same age or developmental level. Doctors check for behavior that's: Not typical for the person's age. ( Most children can behave in those ways at some point or another, though.) Has a negative impact on the person's ability to function at home, in social environments, or at work. They also have to consistently display at least six of the above symptoms: For at least 6 months And in at least two settings, such as at home and in school Overall, hyperactivity tends to diminish with age. But inattention tends to last into adulthood. Treatment can help. And a great many children with ADHD ultimately adjust. Some -- about 20% to 30% -- have learning problems that ADHD treatment may not help, though. As they grow older, some teens who've had the disorder since childhood may have periods of anxiety or depression. When there are more demands at school or home, symptoms of ADHD may get worse. A child with hyperactive behavior may get symptoms of other disruptive disorders, like oppositional-defiant disorder. These children are especially at risk to be more likely to drop out of school. If you're concerned, talk to your or your child's doctor about your treatment options. Medications, behavioral therapy, and other tactics can help."
